#Exercise 1: A Good First Program

# The default exercise code is below


puts "Hello World!"
puts "Hello Again"
puts "I like typing this."
puts "This is fun."
puts 'Yay! Printing.'
puts "I'd much rather you 'not'."
puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'

# Extra Credit exercises are below

puts "This is the first extra credit line."
puts "It'll print to the screen similar to the others"
puts "The # key will comment out Ruby code."
puts "An 'octothorpe' is also called a 'pound', 'hash', 'mesh', or any number of names. Pick the one that makes you chill out."

# Notes
# ‘puts’ and ‘print’
# -print just takes whatever you give it, and prints it to the screen
# - puts (for "put string") is different: it adds a new blank line after the thing you want it to print.
